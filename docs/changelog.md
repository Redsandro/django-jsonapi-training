## Documentation changes

Since this project is primarily about training vs. the demo application, this Changelog
documents the changes to the docs. See the top-level CHANGELOG for changes to the demo app.

### 2020-05-05

- Reorganized material to introduce OAuth 2.0 prior to diving in to building the app.
- Removed enterprise down-scoping which is replaced with OIDC Claims.
