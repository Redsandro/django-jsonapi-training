## Preparing for the classes

### Overview

The plan is to have three (more)? 90-minute class sessions a
week apart. Content will be mostly me droning on about the stuff in
these notes with participants doing some live Python/Django coding
on their laptops if time permits. Some of the material here may be too basic or the opposite
so it's hard to estimate how much time it will take. We may refer to
some stuff and then skip ahead. Anything not done in class should be
done as homework. We can always add on more sessions if we need to. For CUIT staff, you can
always ask questions on Slack channel `#python-dev` 


### Expectations

- It is expected that students will bring laptops that have a functional
  Python development environment set up, including Python 3.5 or higher,
  git, an editor or IDE, maybe Docker for some of the advanced
  examples. The examples are all MacOS-based, using the Unix
  CLI. Windows users will need to adjust as needed.
- Optionally have [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) installed
  and licensed (not required; PyCharm CE works fine too). Or use an editor like
  Emacs, vi or atom. However, PyCharm's ability to interactively debug is a lot more powerful
  than `$ python -m pdb ...`.
- git
  - CLI tools installed
  - access to gitlab/github
  - have successfully created one's own personal repo.
- Some familiarity with: JSON, HTTP, REST, XML, SOAP/WSDL, SQL,
  git, pycharm, Python object-oriented programming, Django, etc.
  I don't really care if you've heard of XML, SOAP or WSDL other than if you
  have heard of them, but not JSON or REST, they'll be a point of comparison.
  Similarly, knowledge of SQL can be cursory, basically understanding the
  concepts of tables and fields (columns).
