## Help Wanted

There are still quite a few things I want to test and document. Contributions are welcome and encouraged!
- Complete the full suite of {json:api} tests to make sure all the various flavors of PATCH actually work.
- [`django-guardian`](https://django-guardian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) model and object-level permissions.
- [`django-signals`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/signals/)
- Use [sphinx confluence builder](https://sphinxcontrib-confluencebuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  to push documentation into Confluence.
- Create a jsonapi.DefaultRouter that automates the added urlpatterns for relationships and related paths.
- Jenkins CI/CD setup for local repo.
- Travis CI/CD setup for github repo.
