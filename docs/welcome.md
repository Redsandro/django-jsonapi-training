## Welcome and Caveat

These are some lecture notes that we use for internal software developers at Columbia University. 
We are releasing the notes publicly on github in the hope that they are more generally useful and accessible,
with the caveat that, while suggestions and improvements are appreciated,
there is no promise of support or even accuracy. Also, with apologies in advance, some
of the referenced internal Columbia University documents or IT services are not publicly available
at this time. In general, these are not something you need access to benefit from this material.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge many of my CUIT colleagues who have helped me develop this tutorial
through their experience and great examples of Django-based development, especially members
of the
[SIS project team](https://confluence.columbia.edu/confluence/display/SISPROJ/SIS+Project+Home)
(this link will likely not work for you; sorry).
