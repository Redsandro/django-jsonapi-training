# Welcome and Caveat

[Columbia Universtiy IT](https://cuit.columbia.edu) is developing new
applications with a microservices REST API architecture using the
Python Django REST framework, the [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org)
request/response framework and OAuth 2.0 for authentication and
authorization for the backend. These are some lecture notes that we
use for internal software developers at Columbia University. They
introduce the key concepts and demonstrate how to build a toy backend
service.

We are releasing the notes publicly on github in the hope that they are more generally useful and accessible,
with the caveat that, while suggestions and improvements are appreciated,
there is no promise of support or even accuracy. Also, with apologies in advance, some
of the referenced internal Columbia University documents or IT services are not publicly available
at this time. In general, these are not something you need access to benefit from this material.
